STUDENT STAFF FEEDBACK SYSTEM

Project Overview
The Student Staff Feedback System is a web-based application that simplifies and automates 
the process of collecting and analyzing feedback from students regarding faculty members. 
This system allows students to submit their feedback online about their lecturers, and the 
feedback reports are then reviewed by Heads of Departments (HODs) and the Principal. 
This replaces the manual, paper-based feedback process, saving time, enhancing the efficiency of 
feedback collection, and enabling better management of faculty performance.

Key Features:
* User-Friendly Web Interface: Developed using ASP.NET for a simple and intuitive user experience.
* Quick Feedback Submission: Students can quickly submit their feedback through an online form.
* Automatic Feedback Reports: Once feedback is collected, HODs can easily view, analyze, and generate feedback reports for the principal.
* Efficient Feedback Management: Staff members (lecturers) can prepare and update feedback questions, which are then displayed to students for evaluation.
* Role-Based Access: Different users with specific roles (Student, Staff, HOD, Principal) can access the system with restricted permissions.

Technologies Used:
* Frontend: ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: ASP.NET, C#
* Database: MS SQL Server 2008/2012 (or compatible)
* Development Environment: Visual Studio 2010
* Operating System: Windows 7/Vista/XP SP3, Linux Fedora 14

Installation Instructions:

1.Download and Install Visual Studio 2010:
* Make sure to download and install Visual Studio 2010 if you haven't already.
* Install the necessary components to work with ASP.NET.
  
2.Download and Install MS SQL Server:
* The system uses MS SQL Server as the database. Ensure that MS SQL Server is installed on your machine (version 2008 or 2012 is compatible).
* Set up the database and restore the provided .bak file (or create your database schema manually as per the instructions below).
  
3.Clone the Repository:
* Clone or download the project files from the repository.
  
4.Set Up the Database:
* Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your local server.
* Create a new database named StudentFeedbackSystem.
* Import the database schema (if provided) or create the necessary tables manually.
  You can use the following SQL script to set up your tables:
  
CREATE TABLE Feedback (
    FeedbackID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    LecturerID INT,
    StudentID INT,
    FeedbackDate DATETIME,
    FeedbackRating INT,
    FeedbackComments TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Lecturer (
    LecturerID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Course VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE FeedbackQuestions (
    QuestionID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    QuestionText VARCHAR(255)
);

5.Configure Connection Strings:
* Open the web.config file in the project and configure the database connection string to match your SQL Server setup.
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="FeedbackDb" connectionString="Server=localhost; Database=StudentFeedbackSystem; Integrated Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
</connectionStrings>
      
6.Run the Application:
* Open the project in Visual Studio 2010 and run it. You should now be able to access the system through the web browser.
  
System Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 7 / Vista / XP SP3 / Linux Fedora 14
* Software:
~ Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (for development and running the application).
~ MS SQL Server (2008/2012) for database management.
* Web Browser: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox for accessing the system.
  
User Roles and Permissions
1.Student:
~ Can submit feedback for lecturers.
~ Can view feedback submission history.

2.Staff (Lecturer):
~ Can create and manage feedback questions.
~ Can view feedback submitted by students about themselves.
  
3.HOD (Head of Department):

~ Can view overall feedback reports for all lecturers in their department.
~ Can analyze and submit feedback reports to the principal.

4.Principal:
~ Can view feedback reports from all departments.
~ Can analyze reports and provide counseling to staff based on feedback.

Features and Functionality
1. Login & Authentication
Users must log in based on their role (Student, Staff, HOD, Principal).
Role-based authentication ensures that users can only access relevant parts of the system.

2. Feedback Submission (Student):
Students can view feedback questions created by lecturers and submit ratings.
Feedback is stored in the database for future reference by HODs and the Principal.

3. Feedback Question Management (Lecturer):
Lecturers can create and manage feedback questions.
They can update and delete questions from the feedback system.

4. Feedback Report Generation (HOD):
HODs can view and analyze feedback reports for their department.
The system aggregates feedback to show ratings and comments for each lecturer.

5. Admin Report Viewing (Principal):
The Principal can view all feedback reports across departments.
The Principal can analyze feedback trends and take appropriate actions.

Steps for Implementation

Step 1: Create User Roles
Create users for each role (Student, Staff, HOD, Principal).
Assign permissions based on roles in the system.

Step 2: Design Database Schema
Set up the necessary database tables: Feedback, Lecturer, Student, FeedbackQuestions, etc.
Create relationships between tables to ensure data consistency.

Step 3: Develop the Frontend Interface
Develop the UI using ASP.NET Web Forms.
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface.
Ensure that the interface is responsive for different screen sizes.

Step 4: Develop the Backend Logic
Use C# to implement backend logic for feedback submission, report generation, and user authentication.
Implement CRUD operations for managing feedback questions.

Step 5: Integrate Database with Application
Use ADO.NET or Entity Framework to interact with the SQL database.
Ensure that data is properly fetched and displayed based on user roles.

Step 6: Testing
Test the system for usability and data integrity.
Ensure feedback is correctly stored and reports are accurate.
Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to make sure the system meets the requirements.

Step 7: Deployment
Deploy the system to a web server for live usage.
